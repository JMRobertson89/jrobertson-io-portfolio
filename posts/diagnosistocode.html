            <h2>Diagnosis to Code: Battling Illness and Exploring a Passion</h2>
            <p class="publish"><em>Published on November 19, 2024</em></p>
            <p>
                <h3>My Diagnosis and Journey</h3>
                <br>
                In December of 2021, I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Life has a way of throwing curveballs when you least expect them, and this diagnosis was no exception. It was especially overwhelming because my wife Cait was six months pregnant with our first child at the time. Suddenly, life shifted dramatically. I began intense rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, all while we were eagerly awaiting the arrival of our son. It was an incredibly challenging time, to say the least.
                <br>
                <br>
                In March 2022, amidst the chaos, our beautiful son Henry came into the world. His arrival was a beacon of light during the darkest period of my life. Despite the joy he brought us, my fight with cancer was far from over. The disease persisted, leading me to undergo a bone marrow transplant in June 2023. I spent the next year recovering, and in June 2024, I reached my transplant anniversary—a significant milestone in my journey. Today, I’m thrilled to say that I am living life cancer free with no restrictions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout this journey, Cait and Henry remained my unwavering sources of hope. Cait, especially, was my rock. Caregivers endure the emotional weight of these battles just as much as patients do, and Cait's strength and resilience inspired me to keep pushing forward. I am also endlessly grateful for the support from my family, friends, and community, who carried us through this ordeal.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>What Now?</h3>
                <br>
                Facing my illness gave me time to confront the age-old question: "What do I really want to do with my life?" Before my diagnosis, I spent years working in technology sales and client management. I always had a curiosity about the tech behind the products I was using every day—how they worked on both the front-end and back-end—but I never took the leap to explore it fully. I always told myself I didn’t have the time. My diagnosis and recovery, however, gave me both the time and a renewed sense of purpose.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I was recovering and stepping into my new role as a stay-at-home dad, I decided to take a leap of faith. I enrolled in the University of Connecticut's Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp. The program was challenging, but I loved every moment of it. I immersed myself in the MERN stack, learned to build web applications, and found the problem-solving aspect of coding incredibly rewarding. I also had the immense support of friends and family already working in the tech industry, who encouraged me every step of the way.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, I’m excited to embark on this new chapter as a software developer. I’m eager to bring my passion, resilience, and experience to a new career. My journey through illness has shaped me in countless ways. It taught me patience, perseverance, and how to navigate complex challenges—qualities that I believe make me a strong addition to any team.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you or someone you know is going through a life-changing illness and would like to share your own journey, I’d love to connect. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto: josh@jrobertson.io"><span>josh@jrobertson.io</span></a>. We’re stronger when we share our stories, and I hope mine can provide some hope and inspiration to others.
